# Work Resumption Guide - The HOLE Foundation

## Quick Start Instructions

When you return to continue this work, follow these steps to quickly understand the current state and continue development:

### üìã Step 1: Review Current State
1. **Read `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-09-25.md`** - Complete overview of what was accomplished
2. **Check `CURRENT_REPOSITORY_INVENTORY.md`** - Detailed inventory of all files and states
3. **Review `REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md`** - Migration strategy and next steps

### üéØ Step 2: Understand Key Discoveries
- ‚úÖ **Database validation is COMPLETE** - all 51 jurisdictions ready
- ‚úÖ **Website architectures documented** - both platforms ready for development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Content reorganization needed** - 98% of files in wrong repositories
- üöÄ **Ready for backend development** - Supabase schemas documented

### üöÄ Step 3: Continue Development
Choose your priority based on available time:

#### Option A: Backend Development (High Priority)
```bash
# Start with Supabase backend setup
# See PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md and WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md for schemas
```

#### Option B: Content Reorganization (Medium Priority)
```bash
# Execute migration plan from REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
# Move misplaced content to correct repositories
```

#### Option C: Frontend Development (After Backend)
```bash
# Begin with either theholefoundation.org or THEHOLETRUTH.ORG
# Complete architecture documentation available
```

## Key Commands for Resumption

### To Continue Repository Analysis
```bash
# Navigate to the GitHub infrastructure folder
cd "/Users/jth/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/iCloud-HOLE-Foundation/Infrastructure/Github"

# Review repository structure
ls -la
```

### To Check Database Status
```bash
# Check validation files
find ./us-transparency-laws-database/statutory-validation-branch -name "*.json" | wc -l
# Should show 51+ jurisdictions

# Spot check specific states
cat ./us-transparency-laws-database/statutory-validation-branch/AL.json
cat ./us-transparency-laws-database/statutory-validation-branch/GA.json
```

### To Execute Reorganization
```bash
# Follow commands in REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
# Example: Move platform architecture
cd us-transparency-laws-database
git mv theholetruth-platform-architecture/ ../THEHOLETRUTH.ORG/platform-architecture/
```
