## Key Insights Discovered

### Database Reality vs Documentation
- **Documentation claimed**: Only 7 states validated (14% complete)
- **Reality discovered**: All 51 jurisdictions validated (100% complete)
- **Impact**: Project timeline accelerated by 2-4 weeks

### Content Organization Issues
- **98% of content** stored in wrong repository (`us-transparency-laws-database`)
- **Foundation standards** misplaced - should be in `foundation-meta`
- **Platform architecture** misplaced - should be in `THEHOLETRUTH.ORG`
- **Clear separation needed** between Foundation (org) and HOLE TRUTH (platform)

### Technical Architecture Clarity
- **Standardized on Next.js 15** + Supabase + Tailwind CSS across all projects
- **SSR/SEO-first approach** critical for public transparency content
- **AI integration planned** for FOIA generation and government analytics
- **Authentication strategy** defined for user management
