## 📋 Project Separation

### HOLE Foundation (Organization)
- **Repository**: `theholefoundation.org`
- **Purpose**: Organizational website, mission, governance, fundraising
- **Tagline**: "Shining light in holes where democracy goes dark"
- **Leadership**: Physician-led with personal political experience

### THE HOLE TRUTH PROJECT (Platform)
- **Repository**: `THEHOLETRUTH.ORG`
- **Purpose**: Public transparency tools and resources platform
- **Features**: Transparency Wiki, Map, FOIA Generator, Liberated Library
- **Tagline**: "The truth will set you free | Free the truth"
- **Philosophy**: "Elections are auditions. Public records are receipts"

## 🚨 REORGANIZATION REQUIRED

**Current Problem**: 98% of content (250+ files) is misplaced in `us-transparency-laws-database`
- TheHoleTruth platform architecture → Should be in `THEHOLETRUTH.ORG`
- Foundation standards and templates → Should be in `foundation-meta`
- Each repo needs localized documentation

**See**: `REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` for complete migration strategy
